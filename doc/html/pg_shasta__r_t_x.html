Introduction</h1>
<ul>
<li>supports structured code architecture, allows to cleanly separate FW modules by offering a set of general services</li>
<li>clean evolution of code base in the future, relying on generally available RTOS services</li>
<li>debugging real-time behavior is supported by (decent) debuggers because they are aware of the underlying RTOS</li>
<li>integration of (3rd party) software is easier, it assumes the availability of standard RTOS features like events, semaphores, messages, ...</li>
<li>adding (temporary) manpower to FW development is easier because RTOS-aware people are more common and do not need to be trained on a 'home-grown' runtime environment</li>
</ul>
<p>For the Shasta, the real-time behaviour of both HW and FW is of major importance. Being able to handle real-time events as fast and efficient as possible is key. From a conceptual point of view the real-time behaviour of the FW (and its RTOS) needs to differentiate between real-time functionality that still can be managed by an RTOS and real-time functionalities that is beyond the timing and management capabilities of an RTOS. Any FW interaction with the RTOS requires the usage of RTOS system calls. Such calls come with a certain overhead (in terms of cycle time) because an off-the-shelf RTOS is a general tool, not customized to a specific application architecture. Therefore, the processing of events and threads is categorized into 3 basic priority levels:</p><ol type="1">
<li><b>unmanaged</b> <b>interrupts:</b> This is the highest priority level. Interrupt processing on this level does <b>not</b> allow usage of system calls. Therefore these interrupts are "unmanaged" with respect to their RTOS interaction.</li>
<li><b>managed</b> <b>interrupts:</b> This is the medium priority level. Interrupt processing on this level allows usage of system calls, thus this processing is called "managed" (by the RTOS). There may be multiple processor interrupt levels being used in the FW, depending on the actual needs. Note that the RTOS itself has restrictions on which system call is actually allowed in a managed interrupt.</li>
<li><b>Thread</b> <b>processing:</b> This is the lowest priority level, obviously allowing the full RTOS functionality. This level is managed by the RTOS's scheduler, therefore scheduling on this level is done at the rate of the system tick and done by the actually assigned thread priorities.</li>
</ol>
<p>For <b>unmanaged</b> <b>interrupts</b> the hard real-time behaviour of a processor depends</p><ul>
<li>on the number of processor cycles when saving, restoring and switching its context</li>
<li>on the number of processor cycles before an interrupt request is accepted</li>
<li>on its ability to support atomic read-modify-write (rmw) operations on a memory location</li>
</ul>
<p>The ARM Cortex-M0 uses 25 cycles for saving its context and entering the ISR and another 16 when restoring the processor context (see <a class="el" href="pg_shasta__r_t_x.html#sctShasta_RTOS_MO">ARM M0 real-time behaviour</a>). There is no extra cycle penalty when the processor is accepting an interrupt request, there are no (visible) pipeline effects. The ARM Cortex-M0 does not support atomic rmw operations through its instruction set, atomic operations are only available in more advanced versions of the core. Thus, the ARM M0 requires to disable the interrupts when doing atomic rmw operations.</p>
<p>For <b>managed</b> <b>interrupts</b>, the hard real-time behaviour of an RTOS depends on</p><ul>
<li>its interrupt latency</li>
<li>its context switching performance, that is, its speed to switch thread execution upon priority</li>
</ul>
<p>The RTOS interrupt latency is determined by the number of processor cycles where the interrupts are disabled by the RTOS itself. During this FW-wide interrupt lock-out period, the RTOS is accessing and potentially changing (global) system data. Such rmw operations must be atomic to guarantee consistency of the system data. The RTX kernel has been investigated in this respect, see <a class="el" href="pg_shasta__r_t_x.html#sctShasta_RTOS_Eval">RTX real-time behaviour</a>.</p>
<p>For <b>thread</b> <b>processing</b>, the real-time behaviour of an RTOS depends on the efficiency of the actual implementation and the build-time configuration of the RTOS. Some key investigation results for RTX are available in <a class="el" href="pg_shasta__r_t_x.html#sctShasta_RTOS_Eval">RTX real-time behaviour</a>.</p>

ARM M0 real-time behaviour</h1>
<p>The ARM M0 real-time behaviour is summarized as follows:</p><ul>
<li>As per ARM literature, the numbers of core cycles from the acceptance of an interrupt request until the core can execute the ISR is 16 cycles</li>
<li>Actual measurements with XMC1200 show 29 cycles<ul>
<li>16 cycles consumed by context save</li>
<li>9 cycles consumed by vectored jump to ISR and pushing return addr</li>
<li>6 cycles consumed by reading and storing the observation timer</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>==&gt; 'raw' ISR latency is 25 cycles (== 250 ns @ 100MHz)</li>
<li>Context restore is another 16 cycles</li>
</ul>
<p>Conclusions</p><ul>
<li>an interrupt rate of 100kHz and a core clock of 100MHz allows 1000 cycles inbetween 2 interrupts. Assuming 100 cycles for a complete ISR, such ISR is equivalent to 10% processor load.</li>
<li>Anything the core is supposed to do on interrupt level comes with a automatic cost of (25+16) cycles. An interrupt rate of 2.5MHz would load with the core with 100%.</li>

ARM M0 Supervisor Calls</h1>
<p>A collection of notes, found on the web and in the M0 book: SVC function are functions that run in Privileged Handler Mode. The difference is hidden to the user and is handled by the compiler. It generates different code instructions to call SVC functions. SVC functions are called by executing the SVC instruction. When executing the SVC instruction, the core changes the running mode to a Privileged Handler Mode. Interrupts are not <b>disabled</b> in this mode. In order to protect SVC function from interrupts you need to disable and enable them manually in your code.</p>
<p>What is the SVC mode good for? An example without SVC mode: Any task/thread calls an RTOS function (aka system call). During the sys call, the code might need to read-modify-write (rmw) internal data structures of the RTOS. To do this in a safe manner, the code needs to disable interrupts while the rmw operation is ongoing. This prevents any interrupt to happen, therefore its code from also doing a sys call and also doing rmw operations on the (same) data, corrupting them. So, all in all, disabling the interrupts allows atomic rmw operations on data that is shared within an RTOS.</p>
<p>Now the same thing with SVC mode: The sys call itself is an interrupt routine, that is, it runs with a higher priority. Now, let us consider 2 types of interrupt routines:</p><ul>
<li>(1) not using sys calls.</li>
<li>(2) using sys calls. The advantage for Type 1 ISRs is sort of obvious: In case their priority is higher than the SVC sys call, they will interrupt the sys call <b>without</b> any latency - since the sys call does <b>not</b> disable the interrupt, there is no added delay for executing the Type 1 ISR. In other words: The latency for Type 1 ISRs is minimal.</li>
</ul>
<p>The 1st advantage for Type 2 ISRs is the same as for Type 1 - minimum latency. Another advantage is (or could be) the chaining of sys calls: The Type 2 ISR interrupts the SVC sys call #1 and makes a sys call #2. This is an SVC call, too, but #1 has not been completed yet: #2 is pending now. Once the Type 2 ISR has been completed (and along with it, its sys call #2 has been set to 'pending'), it returns to sys call #1 to have it completed. Once completed, sys call #2 is (can be) picked up again and can be completed. This chaining allows to 'sequentialize' sys calls, thereby sequentializing atomic rmw operations on shared data.</p>

<dl class="section user"><dt>Updating the RTX version</dt><dd>When ARM releases a new RTX version, the following files and directories are affected:<ul>
<li><code>../doc/rtx_doxy</code>: In this directory, the pre-compiled documenation that comes with every RTX release is stored. You need to <b>delete</b> all files and subdir and add all new ones from the ../doc directory of the RTX release. Note that this operation requires that you are familiar with git. The content in <code>../doc/rtx_doxy</code> is under revision control, so git needs to be in the loop when you delete and add or change files with the same name.</li>
